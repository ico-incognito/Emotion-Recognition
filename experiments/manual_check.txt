Incorrect Predictions:

1. Proper faces-
	No clear solutions

2. Improper lighting
	No clear solutions

3. Objects blocking the face-
	In certain cases the face is detected.
	There is not much clarity as to what are these specific cases.

4. Face covered by hand-
	OpenCV does not detect a face when the hand is placed on certain parts of the face (forehead, nose, one eye or both eyes).

5. Faces not at the center of the image- 
	OpenCV creates face rectangle with the face as the center.
	So the chances of such image being fed into the CNN is very low.

6. Slant faces-
	Such face is not detected by OpenCV hence it won't be fed into the CNN and shouldn't cause a problem.

7. Side faces- 
	Such face is not detected by OpenCV hence it won't be fed into the CNN and shouldn't cause a problem.
